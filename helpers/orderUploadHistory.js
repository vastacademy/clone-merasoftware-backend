// Shared source of truth for "what has the customer uploaded against this order".
//
// Read-only. Used by both the customer-facing endpoint and the admin one, so neither
// side can ever show a different history or a different set of files — the same
// arrangement clientDocumentsTimeline.js provides for admin-sent documents.
//
// Why the order alone is not enough to find the records:
// An upload is always recorded against whichever order supplied the allowance
// (submitUpdateRequest.js stores it as updatePlanId). Verified against live data, that
// lands in three different shapes:
//   1. a service linked to a project   (updatePlanId = the service, linkedProjectOrderId = the project)
//   2. a standalone service            (updatePlanId = the service, no project)
//   3. the project/plan order itself   (updatePlanId = that order)
// So a project has to be asked for its own records AND those of every service linked to
// it, or its uploads stay invisible — which is exactly what the project page showed
// before this helper existed. A service order is asked for its own records only; its
// parent project is where the combined view lives, and repeating them in both places
// would show the same upload twice.
